Web Application Code Generator

The Web Application Code Generator is a sophisticated tool designed to streamline the application development process. Its primary function is to simplify the creation of Razor engine pages and database-related methods, offering developers a more efficient workflow.

By utilizing this tool, developers can generate razor engine pages and essential database methods with just a few clicks. This eliminates the need for manually composing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) database methods for each individual table in the application. The Code Generator automates this process, saving developers valuable time and effort.

Furthermore, the Code Generator is equipped to generate SQL queries and stored procedures, such as the "SaveOrUpdateTableName" procedure. These SQL artifacts are provided in a text format within a designated textarea. Developers can conveniently copy and paste this generated code into their projects, enhancing the overall development experience.

In summary, the Web Application Code Generator serves as a powerful ally in the development journey, offering an expedited and efficient means of producing essential code components and SQL artifacts for web applications.
